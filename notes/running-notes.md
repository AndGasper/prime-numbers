- Why ~`pypdf`~ ~`pyPdf2`~ ? 
- Because I googled python pdf parser, and the pip page for `pdfreader` was the first result. Some data science article mentioned `pdfminer`. 
Shout out to the [pdfreader people](https://github.com/maxpmaxp/pdfreader#related-projects) for mentioning the other projects/libraries.

I picked [`pyPdf`](https://pypi.org/project/pyPdf/) because it sounded the simplest. 
- But it turns out `pyPdf` is now `pyPDF2` since the OP doesn't maintain it anymore.

- But when I tried to find the github/homepage for `pypdf2` it seems like the project has been abandoned...so let's pick the 

- Why ~`pdfminer`~ `pdfminer.six`
- Because when `pyPdf` went bust I was just like fuggit, I guess I'll just pick the first one on the list (which makes more sense than picking pyPdf because it _sounded_ simpler)
- But then it turned out that `pdfminer` is at the end of its lifecycle...

>  PDFMiner
PDFMiner is a text extraction tool for PDF documents.  
...  
Warning: As of 2020, PDFMiner is not actively maintained. The code still works, but this project is largely dormant. For the active project, check out its fork pdfminer.six.  
Source: https://github.com/euske/pdfminer#pdfminer

- So I picked `pdfminer.six` because jesus christ, let's move on.



"""
Input:
pages = extract_pages(...)
Output:

I have no idea why people use pdfminer.

Maybe more guesstimate-ing with the input.




So it pulls it out in vertical slices.

## Workflow
    - Implement
        - pre-commit (local)
        - pipeline itself should commit and ultimately tag
        - Optimize the diff'ing/fsmonitor query for handling dependency monitoring

## Git diff
- Possibly `#TODO implement custom fsmonitor to accomodate diff's in Pipfile.lock`




# pre-commit hooks generate_requirements.py
- Purpose: separate changes to underlying dependencies from changes to codes
    - Why?: Think about automated vulnerability checks. One can decouple the "uh, what's this?" from "uh, what's this feature do?"

- Real purpose: I didn't want to forget to chedck if I actually had the dependencies listed somewhere.



- really a terrible way of doing it by page because it has to load the entire document to figure out where page 9 is


LTTextBoxHorizontal -> LTTextLineHorizontal


- Interesting
So whatever way I have it now,
it's going:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 
then breaking into 
so like the second column
541\n

describe("Page getting", function() {

        return a Page with 3 groups
})



## Tests setup
- I was tearing my hair out about the layout analysis
    - So I'm just going to take a step back and try to get three groups
- [Based the testing structure on pytest good practices](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/goodpractices.html)


This is problematic if you are using a tool like tox to test your package in a virtual environment, because you want to test the installed version of your package, not the local code from the repository.

In this situation, it is strongly suggested to use a src layout where application root package resides in a sub-directory of your root:
```
setup.py
src/
    mypkg/
        __init__.py
        app.py
        view.py
tests/
    __init__.py
    foo/
        __init__.py
        test_view.py
    bar/
        __init__.py
        test_view.py
```



>  `rootdir` is NOT used to modify sys.path/PYTHONPATH or influence how modules are imported. See pytest import mechanisms and sys.path/PYTHONPATH for more details.


```
Tests as part of application code
Inlining test directories into your application package is useful if you have direct relation between tests and application modules and want to distribute them along with your application:

setup.py
mypkg/
    __init__.py
    app.py
    view.py
    test/
        __init__.py
        test_app.py
        test_view.py
        ...
In this scheme, it is easy to run your tests using the --pyargs option:

pytest --pyargs mypkg
pytest will discover where mypkg is installed and collect tests from there.
```
pytest execute
- `pytest --pyargs primenumbers`

# virtual environment setup because I always forget and have to double look
0. which python
1. virtualenv -p ${USE THE OUTPUT FROM STEP 0} venv
    - create virtual environment using the specified python executable
2. source ./venv/Scripts/activate
    - run the activation script
3. pipenv install .
    - use pipenv to install the dependencies

exception MemoryError
Raised when an operation runs out of memory but the situation may still be rescued (by deleting some objects). The associated value is a string indicating what kind of (internal) operation ran out of memory. Note that because of the underlying memory management architecture (Câ€™s malloc() function), the interpreter may not always be able to completely recover from this situation; it nevertheless raises an exception so that a stack traceback can be printed, in case a run-away program was the cause
